            <h3>Making the lasagna</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you actually went around and got all of the components of this<br>
                tasty dish, lt's get to actually preparing it!
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1:</b> In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. <br>
                    Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. <br>
                    Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. <br>
                    Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. <br>
                    Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b> Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. <br>
                    Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. <br>
                    Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. <br>
                    Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna. </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Step 4:</b> Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Step 5:</b> To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. <br>
                    Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
                    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. <br>
                    Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. <br>
                    To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. <br>
                    Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Step 6:</b> Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. <br>
                    Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
